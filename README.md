# Spring 2022 CS170 Project Skeleton

## Requirements

A Python skeleton is available in the `python` subdirectory. The Python
skeleton was developed using Python 3.9, but it should work with Python
versions 3.6+.

## Solving

To solve a specific case using greedy, run:

```bash
python3 solve.py case.in --solver=greedy case.out
```

To run all inputs from an input folder and put in an output folder, run:

```
python3 python/solve_all.py inputs outputs
```

in the root directory.
